This article will provide an in-depth explanation of Git and its many useful commands, in an attempt to clarify much of the confusion on this subject matter. Admittedly, when I first started using Git and GitHub, I was baffled, to say the least. After months of head scratching, trial, and absorbing knowledge from numerous resources, I finally understood the topic on a proficient level. However, for such a vital and widely used tool, there should be a more efficient way of teaching this material. Therefore, I am here to share some insight on what helped me to understand (and appreciate) Git on a functional level.

### What is Git?
<br>

Before we dive into any subject matter, we first must ask ourselves two imperative questions - "What is it?" and "Why do I need to learn it?". 

<br>

Simply put, Git is a version control tool that manages file and code revisions. In other words, Git is a system that maintains a history of your code edits by tracking and storing changes you make to your code. Git has become the most commonly used and expected version control system in the industry. Therefore, it is just crucial to learn Git as it is to learn a programming language. Moreover, as a developer, it is imperative for you to be proficient with Git because Git provides:

- efficient project collaboration
- seamless code integration  
- centralized location to store your work
- isolated environment for code changes
- easy access to prior code content
- full local history stored on your machine
- error reversal
- file recovery
- ability to work offline
- and much more!

So with that in mind, let's jump into the material!
