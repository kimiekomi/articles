This article will provide an in-depth explanation of Git and its many useful commands, in an attempt to clarify much of the confusion on this subject matter. Admittedly, when I first started using Git and GitHub, I was perplexed, to say the least. After months of head scratching, trial, and absorbing knowledge from numerous resources, I finally understood the topic on a proficient level. However, for such a vital and widely used tool, there should be a more efficient way of teaching this material. Therefore, I am here to share some insight on what helped me to understand (and appreciate) Git on a functional level. 

<br>

### What is Git?
<br>

Before we dive into any subject matter, we first must ask ourselves two imperative questions - "What is it?" and "Why do I need to learn it?". 

Simply put, Git is a version control tool that manages file and code revisions. In other words, Git is a system that maintains a history of your code edits by tracking and storing changes you make to your code. Git has become the most commonly used and expected version control system in the industry. Therefore, it is just crucial to learn Git as it is to learn a programming language. Moreover, as a developer, it is imperative for you to be proficient with Git because Git provides:

- efficient project collaboration
- seamless code integration  
- centralized location to store your work
- isolated environment for code changes
- easy access to prior code content
- full local history stored on your machine
- error reversal
- file recovery
- ability to work offline
- and much more!

Now with that in mind, I want to clarify a few terminology that puzzled me early on, before we jump into the material.  

<br>

#### Is Git and GitHub the same?
<br>

Firstly, although the name may be misleading, Git is NOT short for GitHub. While Git is a version control tool, GitHub is an online platform that is used in conjunction with Git to store remote projects (also known as "repositories" or "repos"). There are other Git repository hosting services such as GitLab, BitBucket, CodeBase, etc; however, GitHub has become the largest community website for software development and the industry standard for hosting Git repositories, so that is the platform I will be discussing in this article. 

<br>

Secondly, many of Git's commands involves retreiving or releasing files between GitHub and your local machine. A "local" repository resides offline on a computer, whereas a "remote" repository resides online in GitHub. A repository may reside in either locations or both at any given time. One of Git's main functions includes syncing the two (local and remote) versions of your files, and we will discuss those commands in detail later on.

### Getting Started
<br>

In order to begin, you will need a:

- code editor
- command line interface 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
