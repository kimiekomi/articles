This article will provide an in-depth explanation of Git and its many useful commands, in an attempt to clarify much of the confusion on this subject matter. Admittedly, when I first started using Git and GitHub, I was baffled, to say the least. After months of head scratching, trial, and absorbing knowledge from numerous resources, I finally understood the topic on a proficient level. However, for such a vital and widely used tool, there should be a more efficient way of teaching this material. Therefore, I am here to share some insight on what helped me to understand (and appreciate) Git on a functional level.
