This article will provide a detailed explanation of advanced Git and GitHub operations. In my previous Git and GitHub articles, I discussed the GitHub workflow and introduced - one of the most important Git features and concepts that aid in project collaboration - branching. The ability to create and navigate between branches allows developers to work independently and isolate their program endeavors from the main codebase. To provide individual testing of project features, branching works best when each branch represents a singular characteristic or entity of the main project. When development branches are completed, they are integrated back to the main branch. This stage of the workflow is where we left off in the last article on this topic. 

So without further adieu, let's immerse into the world of Git and GitHub!
